Welcome to the wiki of our Project Lab 3 Main Semester Project!

***
The main outline of the project, as it stood upon completion, is as follows:

* The main control system is the ROS stack
   * This is an open-source collection of popular libraries for robotics projects
   * The main feature used in our project is ROS' libraries for mapping/SLAM algorithms
* A primary robot will be able to visually map out a "space" with a camera
* The image data will be used to reconstruct the discovered space
* The generated map will be able to be viewed in a ROS visualization tool
